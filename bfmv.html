      Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV, are a Welsh heavy
      metal band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band is currently composed
      of Matthew Tuck, Michael Paget, Jason Bowld and Jamie Mathias. Former
      members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter
      were on bass

    They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music 
    career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded 
    six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later 
    in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. A change of style from that of 
    Jeff Killed John led the band to change their name.
